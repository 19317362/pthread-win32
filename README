Building the library with Cygwin32 or Mingw32
---------------------------------------------
Jan 23, 1999

The package cannot be built using cygwin32 or mingw32 yet.
I'm working on this now. Initially it will be made to compile using g++
because the implementation uses exception handling for cancellation
to work. The library is C callable though so if you need to write
applications in C you'll have to grab the pre-built DLL.


The complete source code in tar format and a precompiled DLL and
matching pthread.h can be found at:
