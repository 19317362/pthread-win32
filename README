Building the library with Cygwin32 or Mingw32
---------------------------------------------
Jan 9, 1999

The package cannot yet be built using cygwin32 or mingw32 because
the win32 compatibility stub libraries that come with those tools generate
their stub library function calls from the Win95 dll set
which don't include the _beginthreadx or _endthreadx functions used in this
package.

The complete zipped (should be pkunzip compatible) source code and
a precompiled DLL and matching pthread.h can be found at:
	ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/pthreads-win32
