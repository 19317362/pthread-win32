Building the library with Cygwin32 or Mingw32
---------------------------------------------
Feb 10, 1999

If you have a suitable environment run the configure script, otherwise you
can copy Makefile.in to Makefile and edit it as required.

There is an unresolved bug which shows up as a segmentation fault
(memory access violation) when the library is built using g++. Build
the test program "eyal1.c" and run with an argument of "2" or greater.
The argument is the number of threads to run, excluding the main thread,
so the bug appears with 2 or more worker threads.

The complete source code in tar format and a precompiled DLL and
matching pthread.h can be found at:
