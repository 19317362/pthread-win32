This directory contains an implementation of pthreads for Win32.  If
desired, it can work with the Cygwin32 porting layer to provide closer
POSIX standards conformance (ie. by providing process control).

There is a mailing list for discussing pthreads on Win32 which is
manually operated at present.  Send mail to postmaster@air.net.au to
request that you be subscribed.
