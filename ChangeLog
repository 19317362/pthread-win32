	(_pthread_new_thread): Alter "if" flow to be more natural.

	* cleanup.c (_pthread_handler_push): Same as below.

	* create.c (pthread_create): Same as below.

	* private.c (_pthread_new_thread): Rename "new" to "new_thread".
	Since when has a C programmer been required to know C++?

	* implement.h: Add _PTHREAD_VALID macro.

	* sync.c (pthread_join): Modify to use the new thread

	* signal.c (pthread_sigmask): Move init of "us" out of inner block.
	Fix instance of "this" should have been "us". Rename "us" to "thread".

	* create.c (pthread_create): Minor rename "us" to "new" (I need
	these cues but it doesn't stop me coming out with some major bugs
	at times).
	Load start_routine and arg into the thread so the wrapper can
	call it.

	* exit.c (pthread_exit): Fix pthread_this should be pthread_self.

	complete.

	* implement.h (_pthread_threads_thread): Rename, remove thread
	member, add win32handle and ptstatus members.
	(_pthread_t): Add.

	* pthread.h: pthread_t is no longer mapped directly to a Win32
	HANDLE type. This is so we can let the Win32 thread terminate and
	reuse the HANDLE while pthreads holds it's own thread ID until
	the last waiting join exits.

Mon Jul 27 00:20:37 1998  Ross Johnson  <rpj@ixobrychus.canberra.edu.au>

	argument which is the return code passed to _endthreadex().
	(_pthread_exit): Move thread entry delete call from _pthread_vacuum()
	into here. Add more explanation of thread entry deletion.
	(_pthread_exit): Clarify comment.

	manipulation code. This routine now calls _enthreadex().

	cleanup code out. Call pthread_exit(NULL) to terminate the thread.

1998-07-26  Ben Elliston  <bje@cygnus.com>

	_pthread_table_mutex.

	* cancel.c (pthread_setcancelstate): Fix indirection bug and rename
	"this" to "us".

	* signal.c (pthread_sigmask): Rename "this" to "us" and fix some
	minor syntax errors. Declare "us" and initialise it.

	* condvar.c (cond_wait): Add cancelation point. This applies the
	point to both pthread_cond_wait() and pthread_cond_timedwait().

	* exit.c (pthread_exit): Rename "this" to "us".

	* implement.h: Add comment.

	* sync.c (pthread_join): I've satisfied myself that pthread_detach()
	does set the detached attribute in the thread entry attributes
	to PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED. "if" conditions were changed to test
	that attribute instead of a separate flag.

	* create.c (pthread_create): Rename "this" to "us".
	(pthread_create): cancelstate and canceltype are not attributes
	so the copy to thread entry attribute storage was removed.
	Only the thread itself can change it's cancelstate or canceltype,
	ie. the thread must exist already.

	* private.c (_pthread_delete_thread_entry): Mutex locks removed.
	Mutexes must be applied at the caller level.
	(_pthread_new_thread_entry): Ditto.
	(_pthread_new_thread_entry): Init cancelstate, canceltype, and
	cancel_pending to default values.
	(_pthread_new_thread_entry): Rename "this" to "new".
	(_pthread_find_thread_entry): Rename "this" to "entry".
	(_pthread_delete_thread_entry): Rename "thread_entry" to "entry".

	* create.c (_pthread_start_call): Mutexes changed to
	_pthread_count_mutex. All access to the threads table entries is
	under the one mutex. Otherwise chaos reigns.

Sat Jul 25 23:16:51 1998  Ross Johnson  <rpj@ixobrychus.canberra.edu.au>

	* implement.h (_pthread_threads_thread): Move cancelstate and

	mask.  Copy the signal mask to the new thread structure if we know
	about signals.
	
Fri Jul 24 16:33:17 1998  Ross Johnson  <rpj@swan.canberra.edu.au>

	* fork.c (pthread_atfork): Add all the necessary push calls.
	Local implementation semantics:
	If we get an ENOMEM at any time then ALL handlers
	(including those from previous pthread_atfork() calls) will be
	popped off each of the three atfork stacks before we return.
	(fork): Add all the necessary pop calls. Add the thread cancellation

	pthread_exit() to use.

	* private.c (_pthread_new_thread_entry): Initialise joinvalueptr to
	NULL.

	* create.c (_pthread_start_call): Rewrite to facilitate joins.
	pthread_exit() will do a longjmp() back to here. Does appropriate
	cleanup and exit/return from the thread.
	(pthread_create): _beginthreadex() now passes a pointer to our
	thread table entry instead of just the call member of that entry.

	* implement.h (_pthread_threads_thread): New member 
	void ** joinvalueptr.
	(_pthread_call_t): New member jmpbuf env.

	* create.c (pthread_create): Arg to _pthread_new_thread_entry()
	changed. See next entry. Move mutex locks out. Changes made yesterday
	and today allow us to start the new thread running rather than
	temporarily suspended.

	* private.c (_pthread_new_thread_entry): _pthread_thread_table
	was changed back to a table of thread structures rather than pointers.
	As such we're trading storage for increaded speed. This routine

	and made generic to handle destructors and atfork handlers as
	well.

	* create.c (_pthread_start_call): New function is a wrapper for
	all new threads. It allows us to do some cleanup when the thread
	returns, ie. that is otherwise only done if the thread is cancelled.

	* exit.c (_pthread_vacuum): New function contains code from 
	pthread_exit() that we need in the new _pthread_start_call()
	as well.

	* implement.h: Various additions and minor changes.

	* cleanup.c (_pthread_cleanup_push): Implement.
	(_pthread_cleanup_pop): Implement.
	(_pthread_do_cancellation): Implement.
	These are private to the implementation. The real cleanup functions
	are macros. See below.

	* pthread.h (pthread_cleanup_push): Implement as a macro.
	(pthread_cleanup_pop): Implement as a macro.
	Because these are macros which start and end a block, the POSIX scoping
	requirement is observed. See the comment in the file.

	* exit.c (pthread_exit): Refine the code.

	* create.c (pthread_create): Code cleanup.

	* implement.h (RND_SIZEOF): Add RND_SIZEOF(T) to round sizeof(T)

	"thread". Detect empty slot fail condition.

1998-07-20  Ben Elliston  <bje@cygnus.com>

	* misc.c (pthread_once): Implement.  Don't use a per-application
	flag and mutex--make `pthread_once_t' contain these elements in
	their structure.  The earlier version had incorrect semantics.
	
	* pthread.h (_pthread_once_flag): Add new variable.  Remove.
	(_pthread_once_lock): Add new mutex lock to ensure integrity of
	access to _pthread_once_flag.  Remove.

	and _PTHREAD_HASH_INDEX.

	* exit.c (pthread_exit): Begin work on cleanup and de-allocate

	* create.c (pthread_create): Add thread to thread table.
	Keep a thread-private copy of the attributes with default values
	filled in when necessary. Same for the cleanup stack. Make 
	pthread_create C run-time library friendly by using _beginthreadex()
	instead of CreateThread(). Fix error returns.

	(pthread_condattr_setpshared): No longer supported; return ENOSYS.
	(pthread_condattr_getpshared): Likewise.
	(pthread_cond_init): Implement with help from Douglas Schmidt.
	Remember to initialise the cv's internal mutex.
	(pthread_cond_wait): Likewise.
	(pthread_cond_signal): Likewise.
	(pthread_cond_broadcast): Likewise.
	(pthread_cond_timedwait): Preliminary implementation, but I need
	to see some API documentation for `WaitForMultipleObject'.
	(pthread_destory): Implement.

	* pthread.h (pthread_cond_init): Add function protoype.
	(pthread_cond_broadcast): Likewise.
	(pthread_cond_signal): Likewise.
	(pthread_cond_timedwait): Likewise.
	(pthread_cond_wait): Likewise.
	(pthread_cond_destroy): Likewise.
	(pthread_cond_t): Define this type.  Fix for u_int.  Do not assume
	that the mutex contained withing the pthread_cond_t structure will
	be a critical section.  Use our new POSIX type!

	* implement.h (_pthread_condattr_t): Remove shared attribute.

1998-07-17  Ben Elliston  <bje@cygnus.com>

	* pthread.h (PTHREADS_PROCESS_PRIVATE): Remove.
	(PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED): Likewise.  No support for mutexes shared
	across processes for now.
	(pthread_mutex_t): Use a Win32 CRITICAL_SECTION type for better
	performance.
	
	* implement.h (_pthread_mutexattr_t): Remove shared attribute.
	
	* mutex.c (pthread_mutexattr_setpshared): This optional function
	is no longer supported, since we want to implement POSIX mutex
	variables using the much more efficient Win32 critical section
	primitives.  Critical section objects in Win32 cannot be shared
	between processes.
	(pthread_mutexattr_getpshared): Likewise.
	(pthread_mutexattr_init): No need to malloc any storage; the
	attributes structure is now empty.
	(pthread_mutexattr_destroy): This is now a nop.
	(pthread_mutex_init): Use InitializeCriticalSection().
	(pthread_mutex_destroy): Use DeleteCriticalSection().
	(pthread_mutex_lock): Use EnterCriticalSection().
	(pthread_mutex_trylock): Use TryEnterCriticalSection().  This is
	not supported by Windows 9x, but trylock is a hack anyway, IMHO.
	(pthread_mutex_unlock): Use LeaveCriticalSection().
