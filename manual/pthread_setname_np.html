pthread_getname_np, pthread_setname_np - get and set the thread name
Synopsis
#include <pthread.h> 
int pthread_getname_np(pthread_t thr, char * name, int len);
#if defined(PTW32_COMPATIBILITY_BSD) || defined(PTW32_COMPATIBILITY_TRU64)
int pthread_setname_np(pthread_t thr, const char * name, void * arg);
#else
int pthread_setname_np(pthread_t thr, const char * name);
#endif
Description
pthread_setname_np() sets the descriptive name of the thread.  It takes the following arguments.
#if defined(PTW32_COMPATIBILITY_BSD) || defined(PTW32_COMPATIBILITY_TRU64)
thr	The thread whose name will be set.
name	The printf(3) format string to be used to construct the name of the thread.  The resulting name should be shorter than PTHREAD_MAX_NAMELEN_NP.
arg	The printf(3) argument used with name.
#else
thr	The thread whose name will be set.
name	The name.
#endif

pthread_getname_np() gets the descriptive name of the thread.  It takes the following arguments.
thread	The thread whose descriptive name will be obtained.
name	The buffer to be filled with the descriptive name of the thread.
len	The size of the buffer name in bytes.

Pthreads-w32 provides these routines for source code compatibility only although, for MSVC compiled apps using the VC built pthreads-win32 libraries, the name should be displayed by the MSVS debugger. AFAIK the MinGW gdb debugger will not recognise these thread names.
Return Value
These routines return 0 on success or an error code on failure.
	
Errors
The pthread_setname_np function shall fail if: 
ESRCH 
The value specified by thr does not refer to a valid thread.
EINVAL
The expansion of name with arg has length greater or equal to PTHREAD_MAX_NAMELEN_NP.
